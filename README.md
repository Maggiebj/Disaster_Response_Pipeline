# Installation<a name="installation"></a>
The jupyter notebook file should be run with python 3.X . Need to install nltk and download associate files.

# Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
Built a multilabel classifier to do disaster messages classification by a subset of labels, so the messages can be delivered to the departments associated to response the disaster.


# File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>
There are 3 python files implement the product.

process_data.py--preprocess and concatenate the original message and category file and store the data in sqlite file database.

train_classifier.py--process text and built the multilabel classification model and store the model in a pkl file.

run.py--flask backend implement.

templates--frontend go.html and master.html for web access.

# Results<a name="results"></a>
The disaster message multilabel classification results can be accessed by http service with Flask backend.
